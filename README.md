# restructured-preview package

Provide a preview for Restructured files. Does not require any external dependencies other than a working python interpreter!

This package was built due to the fact that current atom packages for restructured text require very heavy dependencies which
feel un-needed. This package aims to be as lean as possible.

Uses docutils to convert Restructured text files to the HTML which is rendered accordingly.
